# Introduction

Idea form [ElPsyConGree](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/31164700). Using alpha in image to hide one image from another. One image can be seen in white background, and another can be seen in black background.

# Note

For now, those two image can not be to bright, and only greyscale can be supported. So you had better convert the image by yourself to check the visiblity.

# TODO

For now there is no UI, so you can only put two image in the test folder and rename them to `test-1.png` and `test-2.png`. Of cause if the image format is jpg, you have to change the code: change the path in `test` function to your imgae.
